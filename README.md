## ðŸš€ Project `Astro.js` Snippets


- Astro looks for `.astro` or `.tsx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

- There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React components.

- Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
